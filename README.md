# Expo CLI Unexpected Error: Version Mismatch or Dependency Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI: unexpected errors stemming from version mismatches between the globally installed Expo CLI and the project's dependencies.  This often manifests during builds or other CLI operations.

## Problem

The `expo` command might throw unexpected errors, even for seemingly simple commands, if the versions are misaligned. This usually occurs after a global update of Expo CLI without updating the project dependencies.

## Solution

The solution involves aligning the versions. This typically means updating the project's `package.json` file and re-installing dependencies to match the globally installed Expo CLI version.  Cleaning the cache and reinstalling node_modules can also resolve this issue.  You may also check for conflicting dependencies in your package.json.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run an Expo CLI command (e.g., `expo start`).  Observe the error messages.
3. Follow the instructions in `expoBugSolution.js` to resolve the issue.
